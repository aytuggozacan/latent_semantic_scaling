# Repository Overview

This repository contains the essential code from my master's thesis for conducting an automated longitudinal semantic analysis using the semi-supervised technique known as latent semantic scaling.

## Files

- **lss_complete.R**: This R script handles the analysis and visualization of the results.

## Social Media Data

The social media data is categorized into two sections: narratives of living abroad (Cat I) and living in Turkey (Cat II). The analysis is performed across four themes: Economy, Education, Social, and Work Life.

Each graph in the repository illustrates one category within each of these themes.

Feel free to explore the code and data to understand and replicate the analysis for your own research or projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
